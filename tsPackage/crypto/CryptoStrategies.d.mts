/**
 * Allows customizing the behavior of the crypto api to better suit your needs.
 *
 * An important task which should be done in these crypto strategies is public key verification: in general there is no guarantee that the public keys
 * stored in the iCure database are authentic, i.e. created by the data owner they are associated to. This is because the database admins or a
 * malicious attacker may have added his own public keys to the data owner's public keys.
 * Sharing any kind of data using unverified public keys could potentially cause a data leak: this is why when creating new exchange keys or when
 * creating recovery data only verified keys will be considered. For decrypting existing data instead unverified keys will be used without issues.
